# Gold Drop — Biomass Inventory & Extraction Tracking System

**Product requirements** live in `PRD.md` (Summary plus **Operational departments & shared data model**, **Users & Permissions**, **Potential pipeline records — Old Lots and soft deletion**).
**User guide** lives in `USER_MANUAL.md` (no credentials included).
**FAQ** lives in `FAQ.md`.
**Engineering notes** (implementation-oriented) live in `ENGINEERING.md` (see **PRD implementation notes — departments, approvals, aging** and **HTE post-extraction pipeline (runs)**).

## Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py

# Or via shortcuts
make run
```

Open **http://localhost:5050** in your browser (default dev port; **5000** is often busy on macOS because of AirPlay). To use another port: `PORT=5000 python app.py` or `PORT=8080 python app.py`.

On fresh databases, startup can seed a **minimal demo baseline** (one core row per major module: supplier/purchase/lot/run/cost) so list/detail screens are never fully empty during smoke testing. Behavior is controlled by `SEED_DEMO_DATA`:
- if unset: enabled in non-production-like envs, disabled in `prod`/`production`/`staging`
- explicit override: set `SEED_DEMO_DATA=1` (enable) or `SEED_DEMO_DATA=0` (disable)

Optional runtime sanity check:

```bash
python scripts/ops_preflight.py
# or
make preflight
```

Migration CLI (Flask-Migrate via `manage.py`):

```bash
# initialize once (repo setup)
python manage.py db init

# generate migration from model changes
python manage.py db migrate -m "describe change"

# apply migrations
python manage.py db upgrade
```

## Where to test the implementation so far

After logging in as **admin**:

1. **Purchases list + Journey entrypoint**
   - Open: `http://localhost:5050/purchases`
   - Click **Journey** on any purchase row.
2. **Purchase form + Journey entrypoint**
   - Open a purchase edit page: `http://localhost:5050/purchases/<purchase_id>/edit`
   - Click **View Journey** in the header.
3. **Journey page (UI)**
   - Open: `http://localhost:5050/purchases/<purchase_id>/journey`
   - Validate stage cards, status badges, and drill links.
4. **Journey API (JSON)**
   - Open: `http://localhost:5050/api/purchases/<purchase_id>/journey`
   - Optional admin-only archived mode: `?include_archived=1`
5. **Journey exports**
   - JSON export: `http://localhost:5050/purchases/<purchase_id>/journey/export?format=json`
   - CSV export: `http://localhost:5050/purchases/<purchase_id>/journey/export?format=csv`
6. **Operational probes**
   - Liveness: `http://localhost:5050/livez`
   - Readiness (DB + app): `http://localhost:5050/readyz`
   - Compatibility readiness alias: `http://localhost:5050/healthz`
   - Version metadata: `http://localhost:5050/version`

Tip: to quickly find a `purchase_id`, open DevTools on the Purchases page and copy it from the Journey/Edit link URL.

## Features

- **Docs update (Apr 2026)** — Journey endpoints now share one validation path for missing/archived purchases, and Journey export rejects unsupported formats with an explicit `400` JSON error (`{"error":"Unsupported export format","supported_formats":["csv","json"]}`) instead of silently defaulting.
- **Dashboard** — KPI cards with configurable green/yellow/red traffic lights (on-hand biomass and days-of-supply use **approved** purchases only; see **Purchases** below)
- **Biomass purchasing** — Landing page (`/biomass-purchasing`) for weekly buyer targets vs actuals, field submission queues, and reviewed history (first sidebar item after **Extraction**)
- **Run Logging** — Log extraction runs with source lots, wet/dry HTE & THCA output; optional **HTE post-extraction pipeline** (lab staging, clean vs dirty, COA file attachments, terp-strip queue, terpenes + retail distillate grams after Prescott strip)
- **Departments** — Focused lenses (`/dept`, `/dept/<slug>`) on the same data: quick links, rollups, and filtered run lists (e.g. HTE pipeline stage) for finance, purchasing, intake, extraction, THCA/HTE/LD, terpenes, testing, bulk sales
- **Auto-Calculations** — Yield %, cost per gram, true-up amounts calculated automatically
- **Costs** — Enter solvent/personnel/overhead costs with date ranges; allocated into $/g
- **Cost Allocation Settings** — Choose THCA vs HTE allocation (uniform, 50/50, custom %)
- **Inventory** — Track biomass on hand, in transit, and days of supply
- **Purchases** — Record purchases with potency-based pricing and true-up tracking
- **Batch Journey** — Per-purchase lifecycle timeline (UI + API + export): open from Purchases list (**Journey**) or Purchase edit (**View Journey**) to see derived stages (`declared`, `testing`, `committed`, `delivered`, `inventory`, `extraction`, `post_processing`, `sales`) with status, timestamps, metrics, and drill links.
- **Purchase spreadsheet import** — Upload **.csv**, **.xlsx**, or **.xlsm** via **Purchases → Import spreadsheet** (drag-and-drop or browse). Headers are mapped automatically (e.g. Vendor, Purchase Date, Invoice Weight, Actual Weight, Manifest, Amount, Paid Date, Payment Method, Week). Preview validates rows; commit creates **unapproved** purchases (on-hand statuses from the file are capped to **ordered** until **Approve purchase**). Optional auto-create suppliers. See `purchase_import.py` (header alias map) and `ENGINEERING.md` → **Purchase spreadsheet import**.
- **Batch edit (list screens)** — On Runs, Purchases, Inventory (on-hand lots and in-transit purchases), Biomass Pipeline, Suppliers, Costs, and Strain Performance, use row checkboxes plus **Select all** / **Select none**; with **two or more** rows selected, **Batch edit…** opens a screen to apply the same field changes to all selected records (permissions match single-record edit). Strain performance uses **Batch rename…** to retag matching purchase lots.
- **Batch IDs** — Unique, readable batch IDs for all purchases (auto-generated if blank)
- **Biomass Pipeline** — Same **`Purchase`** rows as **Purchases**: early statuses **`declared`** / **`in_testing`** (UI label *Testing*), then **`committed`**, **`delivered`**, **`cancelled`**, with pipeline fields on the purchase (`availability_date`, declared weight/price, testing metadata, field photos). No separate `BiomassAvailability` sync—one record end-to-end. **Super Admin** or **`is_purchase_approver`** must approve when moving **to or from Committed** on the pipeline form (stamps `purchase_approved_at`). **Edit Purchase** also has **Approve purchase** for the standard purchase workflow.
- **Purchase approval gate** — On-hand inventory, dashboard on-hand, run lot pickers, and saving runs that consume lots require **`purchase_approved_at`**. You cannot set on-hand statuses (**delivered**, **in_testing**, **available**, **processing**) on **Edit Purchase** until approved. Existing on-hand purchases are **backfilled** as approved on startup. Slack **biomass intake** creates purchases as **`ordered`** until reviewed/approved per your process.
- **Field Photo Uploads** — Field users can attach multiple photos to biomass and purchase submissions (JPG/JPEG/PNG/WEBP/HEIC/HEIF, max 50 MB each)
- **Field Purchase Intake Enhancements** — Harvest date, storage note, license info, queue placement, testing/COA status, and categorized photo uploads
- **Soft Delete + Admin Hard Delete** — Runs and purchases support safe delete plus super-admin permanent cleanup
- **Historical Lab Tracking** — Supplier-level lab test history and file attachments (including PDF lab docs)
- **Photo Library** — Central searchable media index with supplier/purchase/category/tag filters
- **Photo Audit Linkage** — Approved field photos are auto-linked to supplier docs (license) and purchase audit records (biomass/COA)
- **Advanced Exports** — Date range and criteria filters (supplier/status/potency/strain) across operational tabs
- **Saved list filters** — Runs, Purchases, Biomass Pipeline, Costs, Inventory, Strains, and **Slack imports** remember your filters, date ranges, sort order, and related query state in your **session** while you work, so you can navigate elsewhere and return without re-applying them; use **Remove filters** for a clean default view. Applying filters or changing status tabs resets **pagination** to page 1 so narrowed results are not hidden on a stale page.
- **Purchases list** — Optional **Hide complete & cancelled** on the filter row; **Export CSV** can follow the same option when active.
- **Purchase form** — **Save Purchase** at the top of the screen (same submit as the bottom) for long forms.
- **Windows / IANA timezones** — `tzdata` is listed in `requirements.txt` so `zoneinfo` (Slack message dates, display timezone) works on Windows; install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Slack Integration** — Outbound notifications; inbound slash commands, interactivity, and Events API URL (`/api/slack/events`); optional **channel history sync** for up to six channels with per-channel cursors (`conversations.history` → **Slack imports** triage UI); **Phase 2 manual Run apply** (prefilled new run from mappings, Run backlink + audit, **Slack Importer** user flag)
- **Supplier Performance** — All-time, 90-day, and last-batch analytics per farm
- **Strain Performance** — Compare yields and cost/gram across strains and suppliers
- **Data Quality Controls** — Flag runs missing $/lb; optionally exclude unpriced runs from analytics
- **CSV Import/Export** — **Runs** (and related operational history): Import from Google Sheets via **Import** with deduplication; export filtered views from list screens. **Purchases** use the dedicated **Import spreadsheet** flow (see above), not the legacy Import screen.
- **Role-Based Access** — Super Admin, User, and Viewer roles
- **Configurable KPIs** — Set targets and thresholds; change them as operations improve

## Deploying to Production

After merging work into **`main`**, deploy by pulling on the server (`git fetch` / `git checkout main` / `git pull`) and **restarting the app process** (e.g. `systemctl restart …`) so Gunicorn reloads code. New database columns are applied on startup: SQLite via **`init_db()`** + **`_ensure_sqlite_schema()`**; PostgreSQL via **`init_db()`** + **`_ensure_postgres_run_hte_columns()`** (and `db.create_all()` for new tables).

**Important:** restart from the project root (the directory that contains `app.py`, `models.py`, `templates/`, and `requirements.txt`).
- In this repo/environment that directory is: `/workspace/gold-drop-production_tracker`
- In the VPS example below it is: `/opt/gold-drop`

### Update + restart commands (current directory)

If you are already in `/workspace/gold-drop-production_tracker`, run:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout codex_review   # or main, depending on your deploy branch
git pull --ff-only

# If using systemd + gunicorn service
sudo systemctl restart golddrop
sudo systemctl status golddrop --no-pager -l
```

If you are running directly (no systemd), restart the dev server in this same directory:

```bash
pkill -f "python app.py" || true
python app.py
```

### If `git checkout codex_review` fails with `pathspec ... did not match`

That means the branch does not exist in **your** repository clone yet.

Try:

```bash
git fetch --all --prune
git branch -a
git checkout -b codex_review   # create local branch from current HEAD
```

If you expected a remote branch named `codex_review`, use:

```bash
git fetch origin codex_review
git checkout -t origin/codex_review
```

### Option 1: DigitalOcean / Render / Railway

1. Push this directory to a Git repository
2. Connect to your hosting platform
3. Set environment variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY` — a random string (e.g., `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`)
   - `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string (for production; SQLite works for small deployments)
4. Run with: `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000`

### Option 2: VPS (Ubuntu)

```bash
# On your server
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv nginx

# Set up app
git clone <your-repo> /opt/gold-drop
cd /opt/gold-drop
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create systemd service
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/golddrop.service << EOF
[Unit]
Description=Gold Drop Biomass Tracker
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/opt/gold-drop
Environment=SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ExecStart=/opt/gold-drop/venv/bin/gunicorn app:app --bind 127.0.0.1:8000

sudo systemctl enable golddrop
sudo systemctl start golddrop

## Importing Historical Data from Google Sheets

### Runs and run-style reports (legacy Import screen)

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to each tab (Run Report, Kief Runs, LD Runs, Intakes)
3. File → Download → CSV
4. In the app, go to **Import** → Upload each CSV
5. Review the preview (header rows are auto-filtered)
6. Click **Confirm Import**

The system will:
- Strip repeated header rows
- Normalize date formats
- Auto-create suppliers from the Source column
- Skip duplicate records (matched on date + strain + source)

### Purchases (accounting / procurement spreadsheets)

Use **Purchases → Import spreadsheet** (not the **Import** menu used for runs). Supports **.csv**, **.xlsx**, and **.xlsm**; drag a file onto the drop zone or browse. After upload you get a **preview** of parsed rows; commit imports selected valid rows. A **sample CSV** is available from the import page. Requires **`openpyxl`** (see `requirements.txt`) for Excel files.

---

## Data Model

- **Suppliers** → **Purchases** → **Lots** (one-to-many chain)
- **Suppliers** → **Biomass Pipeline** (one-to-many)
- **Biomass Pipeline** → **Purchase** (one-to-one once committed/delivered/cancelled)
- **Field submissions** may include photo arrays stored as JSON paths to files in `static/uploads/field/`
- **Lab tests / supplier attachments** are stored as file references under `static/uploads/labs/`
- **Photo assets** are indexed in `photo_assets` for cross-screen search/filter and audit traceability
- **Cost Entries** are allocated across total dry grams in their date ranges
- **Lots** → **Run Inputs** → **Runs** (many-to-many through run_inputs)
- Lot `remaining_weight_lbs` is automatically decremented when used in a run
- Yield calculations and cost-per-gram are auto-computed on save
- **Runs** may store **HTE pipeline stage** (awaiting lab → lab clean / queued for strip → stripped), **lab/COA file paths** (JSON, under `static/uploads/labs/`), and **terpenes / retail distillate grams** after stripping
